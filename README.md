## Installing Fontawaesome pro icons

When you bought the fontawesome package, you should have received the icon set as a zip file or something.

Somewhere in this file, there's a folder named `metadata` which contains a file `icons.json`.

Copy and rename this file to `<your config directory>/custom_icons/fontawesome.json`.

Reload the iconify configuration panel.
